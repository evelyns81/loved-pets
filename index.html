                Welcome! We care for many wonderful animals looking for loving homes. 
                Our shelter provides a safe, warm, and nurturing space while we work to 
                match each pet with the perfect family.

        <h2>Adopt</h2>
        <p>Learn how to adopt a pet and start your journey with a new companion.</p>

            Hours of operation:
            At Loved Pets Animal Rescue, we believe all animals deserve a chance to find a loving forever home.
            We provide initial veterinary care to rescued animals, then work to match each animal with a human
            family to love them and keep them safe forever. All animals are screened for diseases upon arrival,
            washed and groomed, and then added to our website for adoptive families to see. All potential
            adoptive families are also screened for adoption history, household lifestyle, and commitment to
            providing a safe and loving home.
            We can always use volunteers to help keep our shelter open! Volunteers are needed to bathe and
            groom animals, play with pets to help them socialize and keep them happy, clean kennels and
            screening rooms, and help with administrative tasks in the office. If you’re interested in volunteering,
            please complete the steps below.
